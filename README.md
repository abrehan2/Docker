# Node-Docker

A simple Node.js and Express application in a Docker container.

This README explains basic Docker commands for building, running, and managing the Docker container for this project.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) should be installed on your machine.

---

## Commands

### 1. Build a Docker Image

To create a Docker image for this application:

```bash
docker build -t dockify/back-end .
```
````

- `docker build`: This command builds an image from a Dockerfile.
- `-t dockify/back-end`: The `-t` flag tags the image with a name (`dockify/back-end`) for easy reference.
- `.`: This specifies the current directory, where Docker will look for the Dockerfile.

### 2. List Docker Images

To see all images currently available on your system:

```bash
docker images
```

- This command displays a list of all Docker images along with details like Image ID, size, and creation date.

### 3. Run the Docker Image

To start a container from the image you built:

```bash
docker run dockify/back-end
```

- `docker run`: This command creates and starts a container from a specified image.
- `dockify/back-end`: Refers to the image name we created earlier.

> **Tip**: To pass environment variables from a `.env` file when running the container, use:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env dockify/back-end
```

This loads environment variables defined in `.env` into the container.

### 4. List Running Containers

To see all containers that are currently running:

```bash
docker ps
```

- This command shows running containers along with details like Container ID, image, and status.

### 5. Stop a Running Container

To stop a container, you can use either the container name or its ID:

```bash
docker stop <container_name_or_id>
```

- Replace `<container_name_or_id>` with the actual name or ID of the container from `docker ps`.

### 6. Remove a Docker Container

After stopping a container, you can remove it with:

```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```

- Replace `<container_id>` with the ID of the container you want to remove.

### 7. Remove a Docker Image

To delete an image from your system:

```bash
docker rmi <image_id>
```

- Replace `<image_id>` with the ID of the image you want to delete. You can get this ID from `docker images`.
